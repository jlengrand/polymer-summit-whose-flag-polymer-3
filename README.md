# \<whose-flag on Polymer 3\>

This is a simple conversion from Whose Flag to Polymer 3. Whose Flag is a simple game that lets users guess a flag&#39;s country, that was created during [the first Polymer Summit 2017's codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/polymer-summit-2017).

You can find the original codelab instructions [here](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/whose-flag/index.html), [a similar repository on Polymer 2 here](https://github.com/jlengrand/polymer-summit-whose-flag) and [a working demo here](https://polymer-summit-2017-codelab-1.firebaseapp.com/).
